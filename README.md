Numbers
---------

[**Fibonacci Sequence**](https://github.com/AussieGuy0/Projects/blob/master/mysolutions/Fibonacci.java) - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.

[**Change Return Program**](/mysolutions/numbers/ChangeReturn.java) The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.


[**Coin Flip Simulation**](/mysolutions/numbers/coinFlipSim.java) - Write some code that simulates flipping a single coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the outcomes and count the number of tails and heads.

Classic Algorithms
-----------------

**Quicksort** - Using [Recursion](/mysolutions/algorthims/QuicksortRecursive.java) and [Iteration](/mysolutions/algorthims/QuicksortIterative.java)

Data Structures

Text
---------

[**Fizz Buzz**](/mysolutions/text/FizzBuzz.java) - Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

[**Reverse a String**](/mysolutions/text/ReverseString.java)  - Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.

[**Count Vowels**](/mysolutions/text/CountVowels.java)  - Enter a string and the program counts the number of vowels in the text. For added complexity have it report a sum of each vowel found.

[**Check if Palindrome**](/mysolutions/text/Palindrone.java)  - Checks if the string entered by the user is a palindrome. That is that it reads the same forwards as backwards like “racecar”


Networking
---------

[**Chat Client**](/mysolutions/networking/java-client) - Send and recieve messages through a relay server.
