<div class="md"><p>This idea is to implement the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haar_wavelet">haar wavelet</a> transform on an array of length 2<sup>n</sup> . This algorithm is a critical algorithm for many image compression and image processing applications, and it is relatively simple both recursively and iteratively.</p>
<p>The solution should take in as input an array of floating-point values, and return an array of floating point values that in some sense implements the haar wavelet transform.</p>
