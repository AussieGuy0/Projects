# (Rectangle intersection)
<div class="md"><p>Write a function that calculates the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersection_(set_theory)">intersection</a> of two rectangles, returning either a new rectangle or some kind of null value. </p>
<p>You're free to represent these rectangles in any way you want: tuples of numbers, class objects, new datatypes, anything goes. For this challenge, you'll probably want to represent your rectangles as the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> values of the top-left and bottom-right points. (<code>Rect(3, 3, 10, 10)</code> would be a rectangle from <code>(3, 3)</code> (top-left) to <code>(10, 10)</code> (bottom-right).)</p>
<p>As an example, <code>rectIntersection(Rect(3, 3, 10 10), Rect(6, 6, 12, 12))</code> would return <code>Rect(6, 6, 10, 10)</code>, while <code>rectIntersection(Rect(4, 4, 5, 5), Rect(6, 6, 10 10))</code> would return null.</p>
</div>
