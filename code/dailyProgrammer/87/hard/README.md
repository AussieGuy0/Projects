# (Sokoban game)
<div class="md"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban">Sokoban</a> is an old PC puzzle game that involves pushing boxes onto goal squares in a puzzling warehouse layout. Write your own simple Sokoban clone (using a GUI, or curses) that can read level files in <a href="http://sokosolve.sourceforge.net/FileFormatXSB.html">.xsb format</a> from the command line and play them.</p>
<p>For extra credit, extend your program to include a level editor, allowing the user to draw his own levels and save them as .xsb files.</p>
