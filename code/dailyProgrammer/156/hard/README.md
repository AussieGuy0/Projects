<div class="md"><h1>Title: Now for Something Upside down</h1>
<h1>Description:</h1>
<p>The [Easy] Challenge was delayed 1 day to be on April's Fools Day this week so the moderators could attempt to be clever and turn things upside down by making a super easy challenge to decode a message to just have people post hello world programs. The responses to that challenge was interesting.</p>
<p>To show how things got turned upside down this week's [Hard] challenge we are gonna make text appear upside down.</p>
<h1>Input:</h1>
<ul>
<li>1 to many lines of text to convert</li>
<li>You must read it in from standard input or a file. (No fixed strings hard coded into the program with the input)</li>
<li>Can handle as input by characters for converting [a-z] [A-Z] [ ] [?!.] [0-9] to upside down characters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<pre><code>This is some text that I am writing!
Soon it will be just 4 lines of upside down text.
How did they do it? 
We will all know soon.
</code></pre>
<h1>Output:</h1>
<p>The text modified to be upside down.</p>
<h2>Example:</h2>
<pre><code>˙uoos ʍouʞ llɐ llᴉʍ ǝM
 ¿ʇᴉ op ʎǝɥʇ pᴉp ʍoH
˙ʇxǝʇ uʍop ǝpᴉsdn ɟo sǝuᴉl ㄣ ʇsnɾ ǝq llᴉʍ ʇᴉ uooS
¡ƃuᴉʇᴉɹʍ ɯɐ I ʇɐɥʇ ʇxǝʇ ǝɯos sᴉ sᴉɥ┴
</code></pre>
<h1>Notes:</h1>
<ul>
<li>As part of the [Hard] challenge we leave it to you to figure out how this is possible.</li>
<li>Solutions might limit which languages you can use.</li>
</ul>
<h1>More Challenges</h1>
<p>In addition to above look into trying these out:</p>
<ul>
<li>convert upside down to normal</li>
<li>find conversions for $&amp;@';/&gt;&lt;+*=_- if any are possible</li>
<li>given a word search the text count the word matches. Count how many times the word is normal or upside down</li>
</ul>
<h2>Good single line Test String</h2>
