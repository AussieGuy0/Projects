<div class="md"><p>create a short text adventure that will call the user by their name. The text adventure should use standard text adventure commands ("l, n, s, e, i, etc."). </p>
<p>for extra credit, make sure the program doesn't fault, quit, glitch, fail, or loop no matter what is put in, even empty text or spaces. These will be tested rigorously!</p>
