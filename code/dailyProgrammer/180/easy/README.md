# Look'n'Say
<div class="md"><h1>Description</h1>
<p>The Look and Say sequence is an interesting sequence of numbers where each term is given by describing the makeup of the previous term.</p>
<p>The 1st term is given as 1. The 2nd term is 11 ('one one') because the first term (1) consisted of a single 1. The 3rd term is then 21 ('two one') because the second term consisted of two 1s. The first 6 terms are:</p>
<pre><code>1
11
21
1211
111221
312211
</code></pre>
