# Tamagotchi emulator
<div class="md"><h1>Description</h1>
<p>You're lonely and bored. Your doritos are stale and no one is online, this loneliness you feel has a cure...A TAMAGOTCHI</p>
<p>For those of you who have never heard of a Tamagotchi, here's a quick summary:</p>
<p>A tamagotchi is a virtual pet whose life you must sustain through various activities including eating, playing, making it sleep, and cleaning its poop. Tamagotchi's go through several life cycles, most notably, egg/infant, teen, adult, elderly. Tamagotchi's can die from lack of attention (in the classic ones, half a day of neglect would kill it) and also from age.</p>

<p>Your job is to create a tamagotchi via command line, gui or any other avenue you'd like.</p>
<h1>Requirements</h1>
<p>The tamagotchi must have at <strong>least</strong> the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capable of being fed</li>
<li>Capable of being put to bed</li>
<li>Capable of going to sleep on its own, losing health from hunger and pooping on its own without prompting</li>
<li>Capable of aging from birth through to death</li>
</ul>
<p>Like I said, these are the bare minimum requirements, feel free to get quirky and add weird stuff like diseases and love interests.</p>
