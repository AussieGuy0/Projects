# The Name Game
<div class="md"><h1>Description</h1>
<p>If computer programmers had a "patron musician" (if such a thing even exists), it would surely be the great <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Ellis">Shirley Ellis</a>. It is my opinion that in the history of music, not song has ever come closer to replicating the experience of programming as her 1964 novelty hit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MJLi5_dyn0">The Name Game</a>. In the lyrics of that song she lays out quite an elegant and fun algorithm for making a rhyme out of anybody's name. The lyrics are almost like sung pseudo-code!</p>
<p>Your challenge today will be to implement a computer program that can play Ms. Ellis' Name Game. You will recieve a name for input, and output the rhyme for that name. </p>
<p>It should be noted that while the rhyming algorithm is very elegant and easy for humans to follow, Ms. Ellis description is not <em>quite</em> rigorous. For instance, there's an extra rule that she doesn't mention that only applies when names start with a vowel (such as "Arnold"), and it's not quite clear exactly what you should do when the names start with M, F or B. You will have to fill in the blanks as best you can on your own. If you're not sure how a specific rule goes, implement what sounds best to you. </p>
<p>You should primarily refer to the song for instructions, but I've includeded the relevant lyrics here: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Come on everybody!<br/>
I say now let's play a game<br/>
I betcha I can make a rhyme out of anybody's name  </p>
<p>The first letter of the name, I treat it like it wasn't there<br/>
But a "B" or an "F" or an "M" will appear<br/>
And then I say "bo", add a "B", then I say the name<br/>
and "Bonana fanna" and a "fo"  </p>
<p>And then I say the name again with an "F" very plain<br/>
and a "fee fy" and a "mo"<br/>
And then I say the name again with an "M" this time<br/>
and there isn't any name that I can't rhyme  </p>
<p>But if the first two letters are ever the same,<br/>
I drop them both and say the name like  </p>
<p>Bob, Bob drop the B's "Bo-ob"<br/>
For Fred, Fred drop the F's "Fo-red"<br/>
For Mary, Mary drop the M's Mo-ary<br/>
That's the only rule that is contrary.  </p>
</blockquote>
