<div class="md"><p>The one-dimensional simple cellular automata <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110">Rule 110</a> 
is the only such cellular automata currently known to be turing-complete, and many people say it is the simplest known turing-complete
system.</p>
<p>Implement a program capable of outputting an ascii-art representation of applying Rule 110 to some initial state.  How many iterations and what your initial state is is up to you!</p>
<p>You may chose to implement rule 124 instead if you like (which is the same thing, albeit backwards).</p>
<p>Bonus points if your program can take an arbitrary rule integer from 0-255 as input and run that rule instead!</p>
