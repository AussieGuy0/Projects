# Blackjack!
<div class="md"><h1>Description:</h1>
<p>So went to a Casino recently. I noticed at the Blackjack tables the house tends to use several decks and not 1. My mind began to wonder about how likely natural blackjacks (getting an ace and a card worth 10 points on the deal) can occur.</p>
<p>So for this monday challenge lets look into this. We need to be able to shuffle deck of playing cards. (52 cards) and be able to deal out virtual 2 card hands and see if it totals 21 or not. </p>
<ul>
<li>Develop a way to shuffle 1 to 10 decks of 52 playing cards.</li>
<li>Using this shuffle deck(s) deal out hands of 2s</li>
<li>count how many hands you deal out and how many total 21 and output the percentage.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Input:</h1>
<p>n: being 1 to 10 which represents how many deck of playing cards to shuffle together.</p>
<h1>Output:</h1>
<p>After x hands there was y blackjacks at z%.</p>
<h2>Example Output:</h2>
<p>After 26 hands there was 2 blackjacks at %7.</p>
<h2>Optional Output:</h2>
<p>Show the hands of 2 cards. So the card must have suit and the card.</p>
<ul>
<li>D for diamonds, C for clubs, H for hearts, S for spades or use unicode characters.</li>
<li>Card from Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, J for jack, Q for Queen, K for king</li>
</ul>
<h1>Make Challenge Easier:</h1>
<p>Just shuffle 1 deck of 52 cards and output how many natural 21s (blackjack) hands if any you get when dealing 2 card hands.</p>
<h1>Make Challenge Harder:</h1>
<p>When people hit in blackjack it can effect the game. If your 2 card hand is 11 or less always get a hit on it. See if this improves or decays your rate of blackjacks with cards being used for hits. </p>
<h1>Card Values:</h1>
<p>Face value should match up. 2 for 2, 3 for 3, etc. Jacks, Queens and Kings are 10. Aces are 11 unless you get 2 Aces then 1 will have to count as 1.</p>
