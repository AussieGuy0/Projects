# Word Counting
<div class="md"><p>You've recently taken an internship at an up and coming lingustic and natural language centre. Unfortunately, as with real life, the professors have allocated you the mundane task of counting every single word in a book and finding out how many occurences of each word there are. </p>
<p>To them, this task would take hours but they are unaware of your programming background (They really didn't assess the candidates much). Impress them with that word count by the end of the day and you're surely in for more smooth sailing.</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>Given a text file, count how many occurences of each word are present in that text file. To make it more interesting we'll be analyzing the free books offered by <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">Project Gutenberg</a></p>
<p>The book I'm giving to you in this challenge is an <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/47498/pg47498.txt">illustrated monthly on birds</a>.  You're free to choose other books if you wish.</p>
<h1>Inputs and Outputs</h1>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Pass your book through for processing</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output should consist of a key-value pair of the word and its word count.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<pre><code>{'the' : 56,
'example' : 16,
'blue-tit' : 4,
'wings' : 75}
</code></pre>
<h1>Clarifications</h1>
<p>For the sake of ease, you don't have to begin the word count when the book starts, you can just count all the words in that text file (including the boilerplate legal stuff put in by Gutenberg).</p>
<h1>Bonus</h1>
<p>As a bonus, only extract the book's contents and nothing else.</p>
<h1>Finally</h1>
