# (ASCII art)
<div class="md"><p>Write a program that given an image file, produces an ASCII-art version of that image. Try it out on <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tJmB9.png">Snoo</a> (note that the background is transparent, not white). There's no requirement that the ASCII-art be particularly good, it only needs to be good enough so that you recognize the original image in there. </p>
