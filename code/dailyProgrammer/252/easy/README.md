# Sailors and monkeys and coconuts, oh my!
<div class="md"><p>This exercise is inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9qU20VmvaU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=47">Numberphile video</a> (no need to watch past 2:00).</p>
<h1>Description</h1>
<p>A number of sailors (let's call it N) are stranded on an island with a huge pile of coconuts and a monkey. During the night, each sailor (in turn) does the following without the others knowing: </p>
<ol>
<li>He takes one N'th (e.g. if N=5, one fifth) of the coconuts in the pile and hides them</li>
<li>The division leaves one coconut left over, which is given to the monkey.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the morning, they split the remaining coconuts between them. This time the split is even. There's nothing left over for the monkey.</p>
<p><strong>Your task:</strong> Given the number of sailors (N), how many coconuts were in the pile to begin with (lowest possible number)?</p>
<h1>Formal inputs/outputs</h1>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a single number: N, the number of sailors. This number is a whole number that is greater than or equal to 2.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output is a single number: the number of coconuts in the original pile. </p>
<h2>Sample input/output</h2>
<p><strong>Input:</strong></p>
<pre><code>5
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
<pre><code>3121
</code></pre>
