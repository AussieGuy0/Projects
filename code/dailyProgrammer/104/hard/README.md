# (Image color analyzer)
<div class="md"><p>Sorry for taking the last challenge down but it seems it was already done. I had searched for "slide puzzle" -- what they're usually called -- but not "15 puzzle."</p>
<p>Anyway, new challenge! Make a program that analyzes the color of an image. What the majority colors are, specifically. Output if they fall into red, blue, green, etc. because saying "1 instance of &lt;obscure color here&gt;" takes of space, especially if that obscure color is a blue or red or green.</p>
<p><strong>Example input:</strong></p>
<p><code>$ color_analyze image.jpg</code></p>
<p><strong>Example output:</strong></p>
<p><code>Pixels that are red: 15</code><br/>
<code>Pixels that are blue: 227</code>
<code>Pixels that are green: 1,745</code></p>
