# SCRIPT it Language
<div class="md"><h1>Description:</h1>
<p>We all enjoy strings. We all enjoy breaking up texts. Time to go bigger than just a few sentences.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity we will be breaking down a movie script. The movie I have picked is Monty Python and the Holy Grail. </p>
<p>So what do you mean by breaking it down? Our challenge is to crunch some numbers on this movie and figure out some fun statistics.</p>
<p>You will first go get the text of this script off the web. Part of the challenge is how to deal with this.</p>
<p>I really like this <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/mphg/mphg.htm">Monty Python and the Holy Grail Script</a> script of the movie.</p>
<h1>By Scene:</h1>
<ul>
<li>By Scene (From 1 to 36 in order) - how many words are spoken. (Anything between [] and () are not spoken words)</li>
<li>Top 3 Spoken Words (and how many times they were used) and percentage of all the words spoken in that scene.</li>
<li>List of all characters in the scene and next to them How many "Lines" and "Words" they used.</li>
<li>The list of characters in scene should be sorted based on count of "Words" used from high to low in count.</li>
<li>A "Line" is any sentence that ends with your typical end of sentence punctuation.</li>
<li>Anything in [] or () we will call a "stage direction" Just count how many directions are given. Note: Words in a stage direction do not count towards words spoken or used in script.</li>
</ul>
<h1>By Whole Movie:</h1>
<p>At the end of the crunch we want this data.</p>
<ul>
<li>Number of Lines</li>
<li>Number of Words</li>
<li>Number of Stage Directions</li>
<li>Number of characters</li>
<li>Sorted by most words the list of all Characters and how many Words and Lines they each got - Please also add a percentage of total. So if a character spoke 100/1000 lines they will have Lines 100 (10%)</li>
<li>Top 10 Words sorted in Order from Most to least (Ties count as 1 Spot so if the top 2 words are "The" and "A" then it should be like 1) "The" "A"</li>
<li><p>Top 3 Scenes with the most Words spoken (Again if ties - both are listed as 1 spot)</p></li>
<li><p>In the movie there are a bunch of characters known as the Knights of Ni. They cannot say the word "it" (forbidden) - Count how many times this forbidden word is used and list a count of "Forbidden Word of the Knights of Ni"</p></li>
</ul>
<h1>Output:</h1>
<p>Given the above you will have to format and display the data. I leave the design up to you. But it should be easy to read and understand. </p>
<h1>Extra Challenge:</h1>
<p>Find a way to show this data more meaningful than just list of hard data. Develop a Histogram or format the data into a format that makes a cool looking pie chart/table/graph. </p>
