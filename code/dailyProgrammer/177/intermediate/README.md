<div class="md"><h1>Description</h1>
<p>Morse code is an aural method of transmitting text through the use of silence and tones.</p>
<p>Todays challenge will involve translating your standard english text into morse code, and from there, into an audio file.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Step 1: "I like cats" - The phrase entered by you for translating</p>
<p>Step 2: .. / .-.. .. -.- . / -.-. .- - ... - The output of the phrase in step 1</p>
<p>Step 3: cats.wav - An audio file containing each dot(.) and dash(-) as an audible tone</p>
<h1>Formal Inputs &amp; Outputs</h1>
<h2>Input description</h2>
<p>On standard console input, you should enter a phrase of your choosing. This will then be parsed into morse code and finally outputted as stated in the output description.</p>
<h2>Output description</h2>
<p>The program should output a valid audio file (WAV, MP3, OGG, as long as it can play it's fine). In that audio should be an audio translation of your input.</p>
