# Sum-the-Digits, Part II
<div class="md"><h1><a href="#EasyIcon"></a> <em>(Easy)</em>: Sum-the-Digits, Part II</h1>
<p>Given a well-formed (non-empty, fully valid) string of digits, let the integer N be the sum of digits. Then, given this integer N, turn it into a string of digits. Repeat this process until you only have one digit left. Simple, clean, and easy: focus on writing this as cleanly as possible in your preferred programming language.</p>

<h1>Formal Inputs &amp; Outputs</h1>
<h2>Input Description</h2>
<p>On standard console input, you will be given a string of digits. This string will not be of zero-length and will be guaranteed well-formed (will always have digits, and nothing else, in the string).</p>
<h2>Output Description</h2>
<p>You must take the given string, sum the digits, and then convert this sum to a string and print it out onto standard console. Then, you must repeat this process again and again until you only have one digit left.</p>
