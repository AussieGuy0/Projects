<div class="md"><p>Inspired by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule">this Wikipedia article</a>, which was found in the comments in <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/rrx9a/15_year_old_plays_dubstep_song_on_the_piano_after/c486ph7">this video</a>, I thought it would be cool to come up with a programme which uses the Doomsday algorithm to determine which day of the week a certain date falls on.</p>
<p>Bonus: Now, learn to perform the algorithm mentally, and create a tester programme! Write another programme which takes parameters (e.g. the desired range of years), give a random date (e.g. if I input that I want a date this year it may output (5/6/2012); if I say I want a date between 1900 and 2100 it may output (17/3/2046)) and then ask for you to enter the day of the week and have the programme tell you if you are correct.</p>
