# The Column Conundrum
<div class="md"><h1><a href="#EasyIcon"></a> <strong>(Easy)</strong>: The Column Conundrum</h1>
<p>Text formatting is big business. Every day we read information in one of several formats. Scientific publications often have their text split into <a href="https://isotropic.org/papers/chicken.pdf">two columns, like this</a>. Websites are often bearing one major column and a sidebar column, such as Reddit itself. Newspapers very often have three to five columns. You've been commisioned by some bloke you met in Asda to write a program which, given some input text and some numbers, will split the data into the appropriate number of columns.</p>
<h1>Formal Inputs and Outputs</h1>
<h2>Input Description</h2>
<p>To start, you will be given 3 numbers on one line:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;number of columns&gt; &lt;column width&gt; &lt;space width&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><em>number of columns</em>: The number of columns to collect the text into.</li>
<li><em>column width</em>: The width, in characters, of each column.</li>
<li><em>space width</em>: The width, in spaces, of the space between each column.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that first line, the rest of the input will be the text to format.</p>
<h2>Output Description</h2>
<p>You will print the text formatted into the appropriate style.</p>
<p><strong>You do not need to account for words and spaces.</strong> If you wish, cut a word into two, so as to keep the column width constant.</p>
<h1>Sample Inputs and Outputs</h1>
<h2>Sample Input</h2>
<p>Input file <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Quackmatic/b19f592be2c0ee9e22d7/raw/45457a757d1f126d94a4736354c78906eeb819a3/c182e-input.txt">is available here</a>. <em>(NB: I promise this input actually works this time, haha.)</em></p>
<h2>Sample Output</h2>
<p>Outout, according to my solution, <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Quackmatic/1ef9af9f3989e48ee1c4/raw/4cbcd546b7bc1dd415b9a804eb93e671d927cb43/c182e-output.txt">is available here</a>. I completed the Extension challenge too - you do not have to account for longer words if you don't want to, or don't know how.</p>
<h1>Extension</h1>
<p>Split words correctly, like in my sample output.</p>
