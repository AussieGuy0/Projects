# To-do list (Part 1)
<div class="md"><h1>Description</h1>
<p>Todays challenge will be something slightly different! Atleast I think the challenge is meant to be for today? Wait, am I meant to even be submitting today? </p>
<p>Okay maybe I need some help on organising my thoughts before I submit my challenge. A to-do list would be fine, just something so that I can organise my thoughts!</p>
<p>It should have the following basic functionality</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an item to the to-do list</li>
<li>Delete a selected item from the to-do list</li>
<li>And obviously, print out the list so I can see what to do!</li>
</ul>
<h1>Formal Inputs &amp; Outputs</h1>
<h2>Output description</h2>
<p>Any output that is created should be user-friendly. When I'm viewing my to-do list, I should be able to easily discern one list item from another.</p>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Input:</p>
<pre><code>addItem('Take a shower');
addItem('Go to work');
viewList();
</code></pre>
<p>Output:</p>
<pre><code>Take a shower
Go to work
</code></pre>
<p>Further Input:</p>
<pre><code>addItem('Buy a new phone');
deleteItem('Go to work');
viewList();
</code></pre>
<p>Outputs:</p>
<pre><code>Take a shower
Buy a new phone
</code></pre>
<h1>Finally</h1>
