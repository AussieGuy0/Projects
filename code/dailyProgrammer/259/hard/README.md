# Operator number system
<div class="md"><p>In most cases, humans use a decimal system. Scientists have suggested that this way to count things has been defined by our hands with 5 fingers each (total of 10 fingers). When the computer was developed, the binary system was implemented because of the two options that electricity allows (current or no current). Today, weâ€™ll throw practical sensibilities in the garbage and define a system to write all the integers that is based on operators and the static natural number sequence (integers 0 or higher).  Call it NOS (Natural Operator Sequence) base.</p>
<h1>Rules</h1>
<ol>
<li>Each digit in a number represents one of 3 operators: -  <code>0: +</code> <code>1: -</code> <code>2: *</code></li>
<li>The length of the number (count of digits) limits the natural number sequence used.  A 4 digit number means the operators are inserted into the sequence <code>0 _ 1 _ 2 _ 3 _ 4</code></li>
<li>Operators are inserted left to right, and there are no special precedence rules for <code>*</code> multiplication.</li>
<li>The encoding used should use the fewest number of digits/operators possible:</li>
</ol>
<p>Possible encodings of the number <code>10</code> are:</p>
<p>0000 = 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4<br/>
0220 = 0 + 1 * 2 * 3 + 4<br/>
02212 = 0 + 1 * 2 * 3 - 4 * 5  </p>
<p>Only the first 2 representations satisfy the 4th rule of being the shortest possible:</p>
<p><strong>optional 5th rule:</strong>  As a tie break for "correct representation" use the representation with the most <code>0</code>s (representing +), and optionally if still tied, use the representation that would sort first.  ex:  first above <code>0000</code> representation of 10 has the most <code>0</code>'s.  These tie breakers are arbitrary, and you may use any tie breaking scheme you want.</p>
<p>The number 2 can be represented as either <code>02</code> or <code>20</code>.  By optional last rule, <code>02</code> is the "correct"  representation.</p>
<h1>1 easy: read NOS base numbers (optional)</h1>
<p><strong>input</strong>:<br/>
10020  </p>
<p><strong>output</strong>:<br/>
21  </p>
<h1>2 hard:  Find the shortest NOS representation of a decimal number</h1>
<p><strong>input</strong>:<br/>
21  </p>
<p><strong>output</strong>:<br/>
10020  </p>
<p>Find the shortest NOS representations for numbers up to say 50.</p>
<h1>Philosophy bonus:</h1>
<p>Speculate optimistically regarding interesting or practical features of using operators and a known sequence as a base system, or... merciless denigrate the optimistic fools that may dare propose thoughts.</p>
