# Math Dice
<div class="md"><h1>Description:</h1>
<p>Math Dice is a game where you use dice and number combinations to score. It's a neat way for kids to get mathematical dexterity. In the game, you first roll the 12-sided Target Die to get your target number, then roll the five 6-sided Scoring Dice. Using addition and/or subtraction, combine the Scoring Dice to match the target number. The number of dice you used to achieve the target number is your score for that round. For more information, see the product page for the game: (<a href="http://www.thinkfun.com/mathdice">http://www.thinkfun.com/mathdice</a>)</p>
