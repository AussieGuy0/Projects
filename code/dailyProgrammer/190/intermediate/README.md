# Words inside of words
<div class="md"><h1>Description</h1>
<p>This weeks challenge is a short yet interesting one that should hopefully help you exercise elegant solutions to a problem rather than bruteforcing a challenge.</p>
<h1>Challenge</h1>
<p>Given the wordlist <a href="http://www.joereynoldsaudio.com/enable1.txt">enable1.txt</a>, you must find the word in that file which also contains the greatest number of words within that word.</p>
<p>For example, the word 'grayson' has the following words in it</p>
<p>Grayson</p>
<p>Gray</p>
<p>Grays</p>
<p>Ray</p>
<p>Rays</p>
<p>Son</p>
<p>On</p>
<p>Here's another example, the word 'reports' has the following</p>
<p>reports</p>
<p>report</p>
<p>port</p>
<p>ports</p>
<p>rep</p>
<p>You're tasked with finding the word in that file that contains the most words.</p>
<p>NOTE : If you have a different wordlist you would like to use, you're free to do so.</p>
<h1>Restrictions</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>To keep output slightly shorter, a word will only be considered a word if it is 2 or more letters in length</p></li>
<li><p>The word you are using may not be permuted to get a different set of words (You can't change 'report' to 'repotr' so that you can add more words to your list)</p></li>
</ul>
