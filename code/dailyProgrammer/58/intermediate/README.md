<div class="md"><p>For the easy part of today's challenge, we considered numbers that are palindromes in different bases. For this problem, lets only concern ourselves with numbers that are palindromes in base 10.</p>
<p>Define a function P(N) that takes as input a number N, and returns the smallest base 10 palindrome larger than N (i.e. it returns the "next" palindrome after N). So, for instance:</p>
<p>P(808) = 818<br/>
P(999) = 1001<br/>
P(2133) = 2222    </p>
<p>What is P( 3<sup>39</sup> )?</p>
<hr/>
<p>BONUS: What is P( 7<sup>100</sup> )</p>
