# Polygon diagonals
<div class="md"><h1><a href="#HardIcon"></a> <em>(Hard)</em>: Polygon diagonals</h1>
<p>In how many distinct ways can you divide a regular N-sided polygon into N-2 triangles using N-3 non-intersecting diagonals?</p>
<p>For instance, there are 3 ways to do divide a regular hexagon (6-sided polygon) into 4 triangles using 3 non-intersecting diagonals, as shown here: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/gEQHq.gif">http://i.imgur.com/gEQHq.gif</a></p>
<p>A <em>diagonal</em> of a regular polygon is a line joining two non-adjacent vertices. Two diagonals are <em>non-intersecting</em> if they don't cross within the interior of the polygon. Two ways are <em>distinct</em> if one cannot be rotated and/or reflected to become the other.</p>
<p>What's the largest N that your program can handle in a reasonable amount of time? Post the solution for N = 23 if you can get it.</p>
