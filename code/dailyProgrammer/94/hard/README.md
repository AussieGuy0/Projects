# (Simple Lisp interpreter)
<div class="md"><p>Lisp is a family of programming languages, known for its extremely simple notation (called S-expressions) in which programs are defined as lists and code can be modified as data. Your task is to write an interpreter for a simple subset of Lisp.</p>
<p>Peter Norvig wrote a <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html">popular article on how to write a simple Lisp interpreter</a> in only 90 lines of Python. You can choose to port his code to a language of your choice, or write one on your own, from scratch. Bonus points for solving today's easy challenge (or maybe even <em>this</em> challenge) in your own Lisp dialect!</p>
