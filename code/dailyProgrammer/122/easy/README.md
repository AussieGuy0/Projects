# Sum Them Digits
<div class="md"><h1><a href="#EasyIcon" rel="nofollow"></a> <em>(Easy)</em>: Sum Them Digits</h1>
<p>As a crude form of hashing function, Lars wants to sum the digits of a number. Then he wants to sum the digits of the result, and repeat until he have only one digit left. He learnt that this is called the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_root" rel="nofollow">digital root</a> of a number, but the Wikipedia article is just confusing him.</p>
<p>Can you help him implement this problem in your favourite programming language?</p>
<p>It is possible to treat the number as a string and work with each character at a time. This is pretty slow on big numbers, though, so Lars wants you to at least try solving it with only integer calculations (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation" rel="nofollow">modulo operator</a> may prove to be useful!).</p>
