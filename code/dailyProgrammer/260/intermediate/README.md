# Diagonal collision
<div class="md"><h1>Description</h1>
<p>You have one rectangle composed of X*Y squares, with X being the width and Y being the height. You want to know how many squares you are going to collide if you were to draw a diagonal, meaning a line between the bottom-left edge and the top-right edge.</p>
<h1>Input Description</h1>
<p>2 unsigned integers X and Y</p>
<h1>Output Description</h1>
<p>Number of squares that collide with the diagonal.</p>
<h1>Sample Inputs</h1>
<p>Sample Input 1 : 5 2
Sample Input 2 : 3 9</p>
<h1>Sample Outputs</h1>
<p>For this first case, the squares marked as X would collide with the diagonal :</p>
<pre><code>..XXX
XXX..
</code></pre>
<p>meaning the Sample Output 1 is 6</p>
<p>Sample Output 2 : 9 </p>
<h1>Challenge Input</h1>
<p>Input 0 : 3 9
Input 1 : 21 2
Input 2 : 168 189
Input 3 : 100 101
Input 4 : 123456789 987654321</p>
<h1>Bonus</h1>
<p>For small numbers, you can output on the standard output which squares would collide, like so :</p>
<pre><code>..XXX
XXX..
</code></pre>
