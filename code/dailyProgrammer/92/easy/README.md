# (Digital number display)
<div class="md"><p>Today's easy challenge is to write a program that draws a number in the terminal that looks like one of those old school <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display">seven segment displays</a> you find in alarm clocks and VCRs. For instance, if you wanted to draw the number 5362, it would look somthing like:</p>
<pre><code>+--+  +--+  +--+  +--+
|        |  |        |
|        |  |        |
+--+  +--+  +--+  +--+
   |     |  |  |  |
   |     |  |  |  |
+--+  +--+  +--+  +--+
</code></pre>
<p>I've added some +'s to the joints to make it a bit more readable, but that's optional. </p>
<p>Bonus: Write the program so that the numbers are scalable. In other words, that example would have a scale of 2 (since every line is two terminal characters long), but your program should also be able to draw them in a scale of 3, 4, 5, etc.</p>
