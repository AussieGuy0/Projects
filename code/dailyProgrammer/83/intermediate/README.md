# (Indexed file search)
<div class="md"><p>For this challenge, write two programs: </p>
<ul>
<li>'index file1 file2 file3 ...' which creates an index of the words used in the given files (you can assume that they are plain text)</li>
<li>'search word1 word2 ...' which prints the name of every file in the index that contains all of the words given. This program should use the index previously built to find the files very quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p>The speed of the "index" program doesn't matter much (i.e. you don't need to optimize it all that much), but "search" should finish very quickly, almost instantly. It should also scale very well, it shouldn't take longer to search an index of 10000 files compared to an index of 100 files. Google, after all, can handle the same task for billions/milliards* of documents, perhaps even trillions/billions!</p>
<p><em>(</em>*<em>see easy problem for explanation)</em></p>
<p>Index a folder where you have a lot of text files, which on my computer would probably mean the folders where I store the programs I've written. If you don't have a lot text files, head over to Project Gutenberg and go nuts. </p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
