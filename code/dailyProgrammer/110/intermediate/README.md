# Creepy Crawlies
<div class="md"><p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>The web is full of creepy stories, with Reddit's <a href="/r/nosleep">/r/nosleep</a> at the top of this list. Since you're a huge fan of not sleeping (we are programmers, after all), you need to amass a collection of creepy stories into a single file for easy reading access! Your goal is to write a web-crawler that downloads all the text submissions from the top 100 posts on <a href="/r/nosleep">/r/nosleep</a> and puts it into a simple text-file.</p>
<p><strong>Formal Inputs &amp; Outputs:</strong></p>
<p><em>Input Description:</em></p>
<p>No formal input: the application should simply launch and download the top 100 posts from <a href="/r/nosleep">/r/nosleep</a> into a special file format.</p>
<p><em>Output Description:</em></p>
<p>Your application must either save to a file, or print to standard output, the following format: each story should start with a title line. This line is three equal-signs, the posts's name, and then three more equal-signs. An example is "=== People are Scary! ===". The following lines are the story itself, written in regular plain text. No need to worry about formatting, HTML links, bullet points, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Inputs &amp; Outputs:</strong></p>
<p>If I were to run the application now, the following would be examples of output:</p>
<p>=== Can I use the bathroom? ===</p>
<p>Since tonight's Halloween, I couldn't... (your program should print the rest of the story, I omit that for example brevity)</p>
<p>=== She's a keeper. ===</p>
<p>I love this girl with all of my... (your program should print the rest of the story, I omit that for example brevity)</p>
