<div class="md"><p>An “upside up” number is a number that reads the same when it is rotated 180°. For instance, 689 and 1961 are upside up numbers.</p>
<p>Your task is to find the next upside up number greater than 1961, and to count the number of upside up numbers less than ten thousand.</p>
<p>edit: since there is a confusion about 2 and 5, please consider them as "upside up" numbers for this problem. If you have already done without it, its ok. Sorry for the late reply.</p>
