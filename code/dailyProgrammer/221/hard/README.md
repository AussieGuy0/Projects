# Poetry in a haystack
<div class="md"><h1>Description</h1>
<p>Today we're going to try something a little bit different. </p>
<p>You're are going to be given a file with 50,000 lines of text in it. 49,997 of those lines are going to be gibberish, but 3 lines are going to be part of a famous poem. Your task today is to find those three lines. </p>
<p>A few notes: </p>
<ul>
<li>All text in the file is lower-case</li>
<li>All lines contain nothing but alphabetic characters, spaces, and a few pieces of punctuation</li>
<li>The lines of poetry are written in English</li>
<li>The three lines of the poem is in the file in the right order, but split up with lines of gibberish.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Formal inputs &amp; outputs</h1>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input for this challenge is <a href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/anonymous/c8fb349e9ae4fcb40cb5/raw/05a1ef03626057e1b57b5bbdddc4c2373ce4b465/challenge.txt">this</a> aforementioned file. Download it and use it as input for your problems. </p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The three lines of the poem, in the right order. </p>
<p>Note that it might be the case that you reduce the number of possible lines to some very low number (say, 10-20 lines), after which you can easily use visual inspection to find the right lines. This is an acceptable way to solve the problem, but I <em>highly encourage</em> you to try and find a way to print only the correct lines. </p>
<p>Oh, and by the way: if you happen to figure out what the right lines are exactly, either from visual inspection, reading it in a comment here (if you do solve the problem and wish to post the output, please indent the output with four space so as to hide the text as a spoiler), or any other way, you are not allowed to just put in a search function in your code for the correct words. That's cheating :). You have to figure out a way to do it "legitimately", and write the code pretending you have no idea what the lines are supposed to be. </p>
<h1>Notes</h1>
<p>If you have a suggestion for a problem, please head to <a href="/r/dailyprogrammer_ideas">/r/dailyprogrammer_ideas</a> and suggest it! </p>
<p>Much thanks today to <a href="/u/adrian17">/u/adrian17</a> for some comments on the design of the problem on IRC. By the way, did you know we have an IRC channel where you can go to chat with other dailyprogrammers and get help on problems you are struggling with? It's on irc.freenode.net in the channel #reddit-dailyprogrammer. Why don't you stop by if you have a chance?</p>
<p>On another note: I was unsure how to classify this problem, whether it is hard enough for the [Hard] difficulty. I would much appreciate feedback on whether you guys think this is an appropriate challenge for [Hard] and whether it was a good challenge in general. Be honest but gentle :) </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
