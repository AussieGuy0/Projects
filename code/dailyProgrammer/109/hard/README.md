# Death Mountains
<div class="md"><p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>You are a proud explorer, walking towards a range of mountains. These mountains, as they appear to you, are a series of isosceles triangles all clustered on the horizon. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/lyhMt">Check out this example image</a>, sketched by your awesome aid nint22 (smiling-mountain not important). Your goal, given the position of the base of these triangles, how tall they are, and their base-width, is to compute the overall unique area. Note that you should not count areas that have overlapping mountains - you only care about what you can see (i.e. only count the purple areas once in the <a href="http://imgur.com/a/lyhMt">example image</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Formal Inputs &amp; Outputs:</strong></p>
<p><em>Input Description:</em></p>
<p>Integer n - The number of triangles</p>
<p>Array of triangles T - An array of triangles, where each triangle has a position (float x), a base-length (float width), and a triangle-height (float height).</p>
<p><em>Output Description:</em></p>
<p>Print the area of the triangles you see (without measuring overlap more than once), accurate to the second decimal digit.</p>
<p><strong>Sample Inputs &amp; Outputs:</strong></p>
<p>Todo... will have to solve this myself (which is pretty dang hard).</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<p>It is critically important to NOT count overlapped triangle areas more than once. Again, only count the purple areas once in the <a href="http://imgur.com/a/lyhMt">example image</a>..</p>
