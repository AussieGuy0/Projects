# Longest word ladder
<div class="md"><p>What's the longest valid <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/149kec/1242012_challenge_114_easy_word_ladder_steps/">word ladder</a> you can make using <a href="http://pastebin.com/zY4Xt7iB">this list of 3,807 four-letter words</a> without repeating any words? (Normally a word ladder would require you to take the shortest possible path between two words, but obviously you don't do that here.)</p>
<p><a href="http://pastebin.com/DgeX0CTC">Here's a ladder I found of 1,709 words</a>. What's the best you can do? Also post the code you used to generate it, of course.</p>
