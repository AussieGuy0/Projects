<div class="md"><p>Create a piece of code that downloads an entire album from imgur. It should support multiple arguments. e.g.</p>
<p>imgurDownloader <a href="http://imgur.com/a/0NZBe">http://imgur.com/a/0NZBe</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/a/OKduw">http://imgur.com/a/OKduw</a></p>
<p>The url might get a bit redundant for large batch's, so consider leaving out the link, so one just needs to enter 0NZBe OKduw ect. You can use a third party librarys.</p>
<p>Tip: every single image link in an album is listed in the source code.</p>
<p>Bonus points: You can enter the directory you would like to save the files but it's optional. Extra bonus points: if you can change all the file-names into something readable, that's also customizable. For example if I wanted all my images called wallpapers<em>001, wallpapers_002, ect. I would just add wallpapers</em># as an argument.</p>
<p>thanks to koldof for this challenge!</p>
