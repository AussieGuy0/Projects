# Assemble this Scheme into Python
<div class="md"><h2>Description</h2>
<p>You have just been hired by the company 'Super-Corp 5000' and they require you to be up to speed on a new programming language you haven't yet tried.</p>
<p>It is your task to familiarise yourself with this language following this criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The language must be one you've shown interest for in the past </li>
<li>You must not have had past experience with the language</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to Impress HR and convince the manager to hire you, you must complete 5 small tasks. You will definitely be hired if you complete the bonus task.</p>
<h2>Input &amp; Output</h2>
<p>These 5 tasks are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Output 'Hello World' to the console.</p></li>
<li><p>Return an array of the first 100 numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a program that verifies if a word is an anagram of another word.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a program that removes a specificed letter from a word.</p></li>
<li><p>Sum all the elements of an array</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All output will be the expected output of these processes which can be verified in your normal programming language.</p>
<h2>Bonus</h2>
<p>Implement a bubble-sort.</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>Don't use a language you've had contact with before, otherwise this will be very easy. The idea is to learn a new language that you've been curious about.</p>
