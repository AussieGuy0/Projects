<div class="md"><p>Imagine each letter and its position within the alphabet. Now assign each letter its corresponding value ie a=1, b=2,... z=26. When given a list of words, order the words by the sum of the values of the letters in their names.</p>
<p>Example: Shoe and Hat</p>
<p>Hat: 8+1+20 = 29</p>
<p>Shoe: 19+8+15+5 = 47</p>
<p>So the order would be Hat, Shoe.</p>
<p>For extra points, divide by the sum by the number of letters in that word and then rank them.</p>
