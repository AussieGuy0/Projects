<div class="md"><p>Implement a program you can use to play the classic game of chess. White and black alternate inputting their moves using some form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_notation">chess notation</a>. The computer checks if the moves are legal and if so, executes them. The program should be able to tell whenever a player is in check or check-mate. You can represent the chessboard in the terminal in ascii form.</p>
<p>Bonus: implement a simple AI that can play chess against you.</p>
