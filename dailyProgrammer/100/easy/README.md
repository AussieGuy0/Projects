# (Sleep Cycle Estimator)
<div class="md"><p>This challenge comes to us from nagasgura</p>
<p>The human body goes through 90 minute sleep cycles during the night, and you feel more refreshed if you wake up at the end of a sleep cycle than if you wake up during a sleep cycle. The challenge is to make a program that takes a wake-up time and outputs the possible times to fall asleep so that you will wake up at the end of a sleep cycle.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Input (Wake-up time): 6:15 AM</p>
<p>Output (when to go to sleep): 9:15 PM, 10:45 PM, 12:15 AM, or 1:45 AM</p>
<p>Bonus 1: Be able to input a sleep time and output potential wake-up times</p>
<p>Bonus 2: Account for how long it takes to fall asleep</p>
