<p>Your task is to write a program that simulates a game of craps. </p>
<p>Use the program to calculate various features of the game: </p>
<p>for example, What is the most common roll or average rolls in a game or maximum roll? What is the average winning percentage? Or you can make your own questions.</p>
<p>edit: if anyone has any suggestions for the subreddit, kindly post it in the feedback thread posted a day before. It will be easier to assess. Thank you.</p>
