<div class="md"><p>The idea is simple. Use the <a href="http://pastebin.com/login.php?ref=L2FwaQ==">pastebin</a> API (wrappers should not be allowed) in the most creative way to create a cool command line tool. A simple example that's very easy to implement in most modern programming languages is a program that posts to pastebin the contents of a given file. A few ideas for extra features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to post a whole directory to pastebin with one command.</li>
<li>The option to post only a part of a file</li>
<li>Tweeting the link to twitter when posting</li>
<li>Language recognition for the filename</li>
<li>A history of recent pastes with their links</li>
<li>Automatic pasting every few minutes (or after a file changes) for backup</li>
</ul>
