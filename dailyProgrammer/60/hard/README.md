<div class="md"><p>The basic idea of RSA starts with two large prime numbers of equal bit-length, p and q; their product n becomes the modulus of the cryptosystem. The totient of n is computed as φ(pq) = (p−1) × (q−1). Then two keys are chosen, the encryption key e and the decryption key d, such that de ≡ 1 (mod φ(pq)) and gcd(e, φ(pq)) = 1. Then, given a message m, an integer on the range 0 &lt; m &lt;n, the message is encrypted by computing m<sup>e</sup> (mod n) and the resulting cipher-text c is decrypted by computing c<sup>d</sup> (mod n).</p>
<p>The standard definition of RSA cryptography is known as <a href="http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2125">PKCS #1</a>. It provides a method for converting a text message to a number m suitable for encryption, and converting it back to the original text message. It is also possible to use RSA to provide non-forgeable signatures; the basic idea is that the sender encrypts a message hash with his decryption key, so the receiver can decrypt the message hash with the sender’s public key, which works because only the sender knows his private decryption key.</p>
<p>Your task is to write an RSA key generator and procedures to encrypt and decrypt messages using the RSA algorithm.</p>
