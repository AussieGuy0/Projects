# (Unemployment map of the United States)
<div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/yj38u/8202012_challenge_89_difficult_coloring_the/">A little while ago</a> we took advantage of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blank_US_Map.svg">very useful blank map</a> hosted at Wikipedia. The advantage of this map is that it is very easy to assign different colors to each state (for details on how to do this, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/yj38u/8202012_challenge_89_difficult_coloring_the/">see the previous problem</a>). We only had some silly fun with it, but it can also obviously be very useful in visualizing information about the country. </p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/3740029">Here is a text-file with unemployment data</a> for all US states for each month from January 1980 to June 2012, stored in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV format</a>. The first column is the dates, then each column is the data for each state (the order of which is detailed in the headers). I got this information from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/">FRED database</a>, which has excellent API access (good work, St. Louis Fed!). </p>
<p>Using this table, make a program that can draw a map of unemployment across the United States at a given date. For instance, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/O4LP2.png">here is a map of unemployment for July 2005</a>. As you can see, I edited the map slightly, adding a scale to the left side and a header that includes the date. You can do that too if you wish, but it is not necessary in any way. </p>
<p>Your map doesn't need to look anything like mine. You can experiment with different colors and different styles. I selected the colors linearly based on unemployment, but you may want to use a different function to select colors, or perhaps color all states within a certain range the same (so that all states with 0%-2% are the same color, as are the states with 2%-4%, 4%-6%, etc). Experiment and see what you like. </p>
<p>Create a map which shows unemployment for February 1995.</p>
