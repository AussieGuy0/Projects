<div class="md"><h1>Description</h1>
<p>Poor Mr.Tinkles is having some troubles. Similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/52-hertz_whale">The Loneliest Whale In The World</a>, no one can hear his cries. Or in this case, understand them.</p>
<p>He talks in a sequence of on's and off's. 0's and 1's, it's binary. Obviously as a mere human you can't possibly translate what he's saying as he says it. Looks like you'll have to think of a way around this....</p>
<h1>Formal Inputs &amp; Outputs</h1>
<h2>Input description</h2>
<p>On console input you will be given a variable number of 0's and 1's that correspond to letters in the alphabet [a-z] and whitespace ' '. These will be integers coming in, it's your job to cast them however you need.</p>
<h2>Output description</h2>
<p>The program should output the english translation (or other languages if you feel so inclined!) of the binary phrase</p>
