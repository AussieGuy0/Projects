# The Start of Something Big
<div class="md"><h1>Description</h1>
<p>All great things start with something small. Sometimes people <a href="http://rampantgames.com/blog/?p=7745">don't even realise what goes into making a 'small' thing</a>.</p>
<p>A popular story is linked above about a group of graphics programmers who create a rendering engine in some amount of time. After some time HR came to see what the programmers had accomplished. They responded by showing a black triangle on a tv.</p>
<p>HR was less than impressed (understandle for a non techie) but it goes to show the natural evolution of a program. What they didn't realise is that the programmers have created their base engine and can now easily add and extend on top of it.</p>
<p>Maybe you can follow similar steps?</p>
<h1>Challenge</h1>
<p>On your screen, display a square.</p>
<p>You may use any libraries available to you.</p>
<p>The square may be of any size and of any colour.</p>
