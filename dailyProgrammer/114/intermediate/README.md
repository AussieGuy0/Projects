# Shortest word ladder
<div class="md"><p>Given any two words from <a href="http://pastebin.com/zY4Xt7iB">this list of 3,807 four-letter words</a>, output a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/149kec/1242012_challenge_114_easy_word_ladder_steps/">word ladder</a> between them that's as short as possible, using words from the list. (Note that the word list was chosen so that it's possible to form a ladder between any pair of words in the list.) Sample input:</p>
<pre><code>look
leap
</code></pre>
<p>Sample output (any valid ladder of 5 words from <code>look</code> to <code>leap</code> would also work):</p>
<pre><code>look
loon
loan
lean
leap
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Bonus</strong>: There are 8 pairs of words that require a ladder of 18 words to join. Find these 8 pairs of words. (Hint: a certain word appears in each of the 8 pairs.)</p>
