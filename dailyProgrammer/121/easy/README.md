# Bytelandian Exchange 1
<div class="md"><h1><a href="#EasyIcon"></a> <em>(Easy)</em>: Bytelandian Exchange 1</h1>
<p>Bytelandian Currency is made of coins with integers on them. There is a coin for each non-negative integer (including 0). You have access to a peculiar money changing machine. If you insert a N-valued coin, with N positive, It pays back 3 coins of the value N/2,N/3 and N/4, rounded down. For example, if you insert a 19-valued coin, you get three coins worth 9, 6, and 4. If you insert a 2-valued coin, you get three coins worth 1, 0, and 0. <em>0-valued coins cannot be used in this machine.</em></p>
<p>One day you're bored so you insert a 7-valued coin. You get three coins back, and you then insert each of these back into the machine. You continue to do this with every positive-valued coin you get back, until finally you're left with nothing but 0-valued coins. You count them up and see you have 15 coins.</p>
<p>How many 0-valued coins could you get starting with a single 1000-valued coin?</p>
