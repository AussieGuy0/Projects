<p>Text reflow means to break up lines of text so that they fit within a certain width. It is useful in e.g. mobile browsers. When you zoom in on a web page the lines will become too long to fit the width of the screen, unless the text is broken up into shorter lines.</p>
<h1>Input:</h1>
<p>You will be given a text with a maximum line width of 80 characters.</p>
<h1>Output:</h1>
<p>Produce the same text with a maximum line width of 40 characters</p>
<h1>Challenge Input:</h1>
<pre><code>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Now the earth was 
formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of
God was hovering over the waters.

And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light. God saw that the light
was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. God called the light
"day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was
morning - the first day.
