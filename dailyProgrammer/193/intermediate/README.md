# 50,000 Subscriber Meta-challenge
<div class="md"><h1><a href="#IntermediateIcon"></a> <strong>(Intermediate)</strong>: 50,000 Subscriber Meta-challenge</h1>
<p>Congratulations to everyone for getting the subreddit to 50K subscribers! As a reward I'll do a nice relaxed meta challenge. Effective communication is an important skill to have, but it certainly isn't easy; hence, it is a challenge unto itself. This also gives less experienced members of the subreddit a chance to see into the minds of the more veteran submitters.</p>
<h1>Challenge</h1>
<p>Pick your favourite solution (that you have written) to a past challenge, or one that you are particularly proud of. It can be from any challenge, but preferably one with some complexity. Now, describe how it works (via in-code comments or otherwise) as you would to a person. Then, describe how you might improve it or do it differently in hindsight. Also, link to the challenge post itself.</p>
<h1>Thanks</h1>
<p>That's to all of you - even those not currently subscribed. Without your support, this subreddit wouldn't be where it is right now. You <em>are</em> the creators of DailyProgrammer - carry on being awesome!</p>
