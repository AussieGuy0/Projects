<div class="md"><p>A magic square is a square of size NxN with the numbers 1 through n<sup>2</sup> put in so that all rows, all columns and both diagonals sum to the same number. For instance, this is a 3x3 magic square:</p>
<pre><code>8 1 6
3 5 7   
4 9 2
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see all rows, all columns and both diagonals (8+5+2 and 4+5+6) sum to the same number, 15.</p>
<p>Write a program that draws a magic square of size 18x18.</p>
