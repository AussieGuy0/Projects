# Probability Distribution of a 6 Sided Di
<div class="md"><h1>Description:</h1>
<p>Today's challenge we explore some curiosity in rolling a 6 sided di. I often wonder about the outcomes of a rolling a simple 6 side di in a game or even simulating the roll on a computer.</p>
<p>I could roll a 6 side di and record the results. This can be time consuming, tedious and I think it is something a computer can do very well.</p>
<p>So what I want to do is simulate rolling a 6 sided di in 6 groups and record how often each number 1-6 comes up. Then print out a fancy chart comparing the data. What I want to see is if I roll the 6 sided di more often does the results flatten out in distribution of the results or is it very chaotic and have spikes in what numbers can come up.</p>
<p>So roll a D6 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000 times and each time record how often a 1-6 comes up and produce a chart of % of each outcome.</p>
<p>Run the program one time or several times and decide for yourself. Does the results flatten out over time? Is it always flat? Spikes can occur?</p>
<h1>Input:</h1>
<p>None.</p>
<h1>Output:</h1>
<p>Show a nicely formatted chart showing the groups of rolls and the percentages of results coming up for human analysis.</p>

<pre><code># of Rolls 1s     2s     3s     4s     5s     6s       
====================================================
10         18.10% 19.20% 18.23% 20.21% 22.98% 23.20%
100        18.10% 19.20% 18.23% 20.21% 22.98% 23.20%
1000       18.10% 19.20% 18.23% 20.21% 22.98% 23.20%
10000      18.10% 19.20% 18.23% 20.21% 22.98% 23.20%
100000     18.10% 19.20% 18.23% 20.21% 22.98% 23.20%
1000000    18.10% 19.20% 18.23% 20.21% 22.98% 23.20%

<p>notes on example output:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yes in the example the percentages don't add up to 100% but your results should</li>
<li>Yes I used the same percentages as examples for each outcome. Results will vary.</li>
<li>Your choice on how many places past the decimal you wish to show. I picked 2. if you want to show less/more go for it.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Code Submission + Conclusion:</h1>
<p>Do not just post your code. Also post your conclusion based on the simulation output. Have fun and enjoy not having to tally 1 million rolls by hand.</p>
