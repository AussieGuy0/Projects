# (Simple statistical functions)
<div class="md"><p>For today's challenge, you should calculate some simple statistical values based on a list of values. Given <a href="http://pastebin.com/vqzTrVK2">this data set</a>, write functions that will calculate:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_mean">The mean value</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance">The variance</a></li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation">The standard deviation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, many programming languages and environments have standard functions for these (this problem is one of the few that is <em>really</em> easy to solve in Excel!), but you are not allowed to use those! The point of this problem is to write the functions yourself. </p>
