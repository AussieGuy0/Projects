<div class="md"><p>Travelling Salesman problem.</p>
<p>There are N cities numbered from 0..N-1. A salesman is located at city 0. He wishes to visit all cities exactly once and return back to city 0. There are K toll booths. Each toll booth has a certain range of functioning. The parameters for toll k are given as x_k and y_k. If the salesman travels from city i to j, he has to pay 1 dollar toll fee to each toll p having x_p &gt;= i and y_p &lt;= j. Calculate the cheapest way for the salesman to complete his tour.</p>
<p>Input :</p>
<p>The first line contains T the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space seperated integers N and K. Each of the next K lines contains 2 integers, the ith line containing x_i and y_i (0 &lt;= x_i,y_i &lt; N). A blank line seperates two test cases.</p>
<p>Output :</p>
<p>Output T lines, one for each test case, containing the required answer.</p>
<p>Edit: Also since some people have problems, here are two solutions .. just see it for reference!  <a href="http://pastebin.com/j7aMRj8M">link1</a> <a href="http://pastebin.com/FgVSZYYF">link2</a></p>
