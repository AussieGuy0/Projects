# (Bags and balls)
<div class="md"><p>Compute all the permutations of placing 9 balls into 4 bags such that each bag contains an odd number of balls.</p>
<p>Ball count is transient when placing bags within one another. For example, a bag containing 3 balls is placed inside a bag containing 2 balls. The inner bag contains 3 balls and the outer bag contains 5 balls.</p>
<p>Some example permutations:</p>
<pre><code>((((9))))
(8(((1))))
(1)(1)((7))
</code></pre>
