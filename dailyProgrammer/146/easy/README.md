# Polygon Perimeter
<div class="md"><h1><a href="#EasyIcon"></a> <em>(Easy)</em>: Polygon Perimeter</h1>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon">A Polygon</a> is a geometric two-dimensional figure that has n-sides (line segments) that closes to form a loop. Polygons can be in many different shapes and have many different neat properties, though this challenge is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon">Regular Polygons</a>. Our goal is to compute the permitter of an n-sided polygon that has equal-length sides given the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polygon#Circumradius">circumradius</a>. This is the distance between the center of the Polygon to any of its vertices; not to be confused with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apothem">apothem</a>!</p>
<h1>Formal Inputs &amp; Outputs</h1>
<h2>Input Description</h2>
<p>Input will consist of one line on standard console input. This line will contain first an integer N, then a floating-point number R. They will be space-delimited. The integer N is for the number of sides of the Polygon, which is between 3 to 100, inclusive. R will be the circumradius, which ranges from 0.01 to 100.0, inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output Description</h2>
<p>Print the permitter of the given N-sided polygon that has a circumradius of R. Print up to three digits precision.</p>
