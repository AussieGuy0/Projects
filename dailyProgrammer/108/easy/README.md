# (Scientific Notation Translator)
<div class="md"><p>If you haven't gathered from the title, the challenge here is to go from decimal notation -&gt; scientific notation.  For those that don't know, scientific notation allows for a decimal less than ten, greater than zero, and a power of ten to be multiplied.</p>
<p>For example: 239487 would be 2.39487 x 10<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>And .654 would be 6.54 x 10<sup>-1</sup></p>
<hr/>
<p>Bonus Points:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Have you program randomly generate the number that you will translate.</p></li>
<li><p>Go both ways (i.e., given 0.935 x 10<sup>3,</sup> output 935.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Good luck, and have fun!</p>
