# (Non-repeating years)
<div class="md"><p>This challenge comes to us from user <a href="/u/skeeto">skeeto</a></p>
<p>Write a program to count the number years in an inclusive range of years that have no repeated digits.</p>
<p>For example, 2012 has a repeated digit (2) while 2013 does not. Given the range [1980, 1987], your program would return 7 (1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987).</p>
<p>Bonus: Compute the longest run of years of repeated digits and the longest run of years of non-repeated digits for [1000, 2013].</p>
