# (Substring list)
<div class="md"><p>Write a function that takes a number <em>n</em> as an argument and returns (or outputs) every possible unique substrings (not counting "") of the first <em>n</em> letters of the alphabet (in any order you like). For example, <code>substrings(5)</code> could be:</p>
<pre><code>a
ab
abc
abcd
abcde
b
bc
bcd
bcde
c
cd
cde
d
de
e
</code></pre>
<p><strong>BONUS 1:</strong> Find a way to quickly determine how many strings this function returns for a given input. If the alphabet were 500 letters long, how much possible substrings would it have?</p>
<p><strong>BONUS 2:</strong> Modify your function to take a string as an argument. Make sure all substrings in your output are still unique (i.e., there are two "l" substrings in "hello", but you should output only one).</p>
</div>
