# (Boolean logic calculator)
<div class="md"><p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">Boolean logic</a> is something all programmers have to deal with, whether we like it or not. Why not automate the task to make it easier?</p>
<p>Your objective, if you choose to accept it, is to make a boolean logic calculator that can parse boolean logic statements. Given:</p>
<p>| = or<br/>
* = and<br/>
^ = xor<br/>
! = not  </p>
<p>Take input of 1s and 0s (or T and F) and output the evaluation of that statement. Try not to use statement evaluators built into your language of choice, like <a href="http://php.net/eval">eval</a>. Your parser should be able to evaluate statements in parentheses as well</p>
