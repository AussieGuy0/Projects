<div class="md"><p>create a program that can remove all duplicate strings from a .txt. file. for example, "bdbdb" -&gt; "bd"</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>we are really sorry about this :(</strong> .. I just woke up now and am looking at this disaster. We promise to give a bonus question soon ...</p>
<p>for those who still have time, here is the modified question:  </p>
<p>remove duplicate substrings.  </p>
<p>Ex: aaajtestBlaBlatestBlaBla ---&gt; aaajtestBlaBla</p>
<p>another example:  </p>
<p>aaatestBlaBlatestBlaBla
aaathisBlaBlathisBlaBla
aaathatBlaBlathatBlaBla
aaagoodBlaBlagoodBlaBla
aaagood1BlaBla123good1BlaBla123</p>
<p>output desired:
aaatestBlaBla
aaathisBlaBla
aaathatBlaBla
aaagoodBlaBla
aaagood1BlaBla123</p>
<p>I am really sorry for the vagueness. Hopefully will not be repeated again :(</p>
</div>
