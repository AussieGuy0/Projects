<div class="md"><p>You are given a list of 999,998 integers, which include all the integers between 1 and 1,000,000 (inclusive on both ends) in some unknown order, with the exception of two numbers which have been removed. By making only <em>one pass</em> through the data and using only a constant amount of memory (i.e. O(1) memory usage), can you figure out what two numbers have been excluded?</p>
<p>Note that since you are only allowed one pass through the data, you are not allowed to sort the list!</p>
<p>EDIT: clarified problem</p>
